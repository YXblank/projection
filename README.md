Here we have created a description of the pseudo-code to help understanding the code processing flow:
ALGORITHM  Transparent Object Shape Extraction With Energy Function
  INPUT: Depth image, Grayscale image, HSV image, max_iterations=100, epsilon=0.01
  OUTPUT: Identified region of transparent object, optimized weights A and B
  // Step 1: Initialize data structures to store intermediate pixel data
  INITIALIZE D as potential_transparent_pixels  // Store pixels with potential transparency based on depth change
  INITIALIZE R as reflection_region_pixels      // Store pixels of the region with maximum reflection intensity
  INITIALIZE C as contour_data                  // Store contour data
  INITIALIZE G as grayscale_distribution        // Store grayscale value distributions
  INITIALIZE O as overlapping_region_pixels     // Store overlapping regions
  INITIALIZE HSV as hsv_data                    // Store HSV channel data
  INITIALIZE refined_contour_region as NULL     // Initialize to null
  INITIALIZE A = 1.0, B = 1.0                  // Initial values of energy function weights
  SET iteration = 0
  SET convergence = FALSE

WHILE (iteration < max_iterations) AND (convergence == FALSE) DO

  IF iteration == 0 THEN  // Step 2-11:
   // Step 2: Identify potential transparent object region based on depth change
  FOR each pixel p in depth image DO
    IF depth value of p changes significantly at the same location THEN
      ADD p to D  // Add pixel to potential transparent region list
    END IF
  END FOR
  // Step 3: Find the region with maximum reflection intensity (peak in grayscale)
  FIND peak_value = MAX(G)  // Find maximum intensity in grayscale image (G represents grayscale data)
  FIND R = region with peak_value  // Store the reflection region pixels in R
  // Step 4: Contour extraction in the reflection region
  EXTRACT C from R  // Extract contours from the reflection region R
  FOR each contour in C DO
    // Step 5: Classify transparent or semi-transparent based on grayscale distribution
    IF contour internal grayscale peak > background grayscale peak THEN
      SET object_type = "Transparent"
    ELSE IF contour internal grayscale peak < background grayscale peak AND
             contour internal grayscale distribution is more concentrated than background
      SET object_type = "Translucent"
    END IF
  END FOR
  // Step 6: Check for overlapping regions between contour and background in grayscale distribution
  FIND O = contour internal region with overlapping grayscale distribution with background
  ADD O to O  // Add overlapping region pixels to O
  // Step 7: Use HSV channel to resolve overlapping areas
  CONVERT O and contour internal region C to HSV color space
  EXTRACT H, S, and V channels for both regions and store them in HSV
  // Step 8: Process H channel for contour and overlapping region
  FOR each region in HSV DO
    IF contour H channel has discontinuities THEN
      FIND peak value in overlapping region H channel
      IF H channel of contour internal matches H channel in overlapping region THEN
        RETAIN matching H channel areas and store them in HSV
      END IF
    END IF
  END FOR
  // Step 9: Extract S channel breakpoints within contour internal region
  FIND breakpoints in contour internal region S channel
  STORE breakpoints in G  // Store breakpoints in grayscale distribution
  EXTRACT S channel regions with breakpoints for further analysis
  // Step 10: Combine H channel retained areas with S channel regions
  FUSE H channel retained areas with corresponding S channel areas to refine contour internal region
  ADD result to refined_contour_region  // Store refined contour region data
  // Step 11: Process V channel to finalize transparent object region
  EXTRACT V channel values in contour internal and overlapping regions
  FIND the region where V values are between the first and second breakpoints in V channel
ELSE       // The non-first iteration directly reuses the results of the previous segmentation

APPLY region-growing ON energy_map AND refined_contour_region   

END IF

// Step 12: Generate an energy map based on the current weights   

COMPUTE energy_map with E(p) = A * data_item + B * smoothness_term   

// Step 13: Regional segmentation and error calculation  

APPLY region-growing TO GET transparent_region   

COMPUTE error = region_hsv_consistency_error(transparent_region)   

// Step 14: Automatically adjust the weights A and B (gradient descent heuristic)

alpha = 0.1  // Learning rate

IF error_prev EXISTS THEN     

// Calculate the direction of weight change  

delta_A = -alpha * (error - error_prev) / A_prev_diff     

delta_B = -alpha * (error - error_prev) / B_prev_diff     

A = A + delta_A     

B = B + delta_B   

ELSE       // First adjustment: Assumption of error decline 

A = A * (1 - alpha * error)     

B = B * (1 + alpha * error)   

END IF   

// Step 15: Record the history of errors

error_prev = error   

A_prev_diff = delta_A   

B_prev_diff = delta_B   

// Step 16: Convergence check

IF error < epsilon THEN     

SET convergence = TRUE   

ELSE       iteration += 1   

END IF

OUTPUT: transparent_region, A, B
